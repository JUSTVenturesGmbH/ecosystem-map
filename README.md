# [Polkadot ecosystem map](https://JUSTVenturesGmbH.github.io/ecosystem-map/)

üëã This repository is the data source for the community-sourced Ecosystem directory curated by JUST Opensource team. 

Our aim is to curate an accurate, up-to-date database of projects in the Polkadot ecosystem to help orient the new teams and provide a solid base for user research and collaboration for already existing teams. Therefore, we have made this an open, community-driven repo to which anyone can contribute.

It‚Äôs a shared space for all of us to geek out on cool projects where we aim to pursue the values of Web3 and maintain an open and transparent environment. We do, however, reserve the right to omit some projects or metrics without further explanation.

As things change and grow, so does this repo. It may evolve over time as the community helps our team maintain the map going forward and propose new ideas and directions. 

# ‚ú®¬†Potential use-cases

**üöÄ**¬†Navigate the ecosystem in general or follow specific categories

**üõû**¬†Find out the tooling/projects to collaborate on

**üî¨**¬†Gather basic metrics to build project/team KPIs

**üß´**¬†Use it as a base for product/UX/stakeholders research

**ü™Ñ**¬†If you are interested in those, but don‚Äôt know where to start - reach out to JUST team, we provide advisory services.

## Awareness funnel

> [!NOTE]
> Media exposure is the metrics that we used for several reasons:
> Identify the most popular marketing channels and calculate average values across the engagement funnel for the ecosystem to then compare with the competitors.
>
> To verify the assumption, that deviation from the median is not significant for the majority of projects, thus indirectly confirming the total number of users engaged with the ecosystem and individual projects and that fluctuations in the number of engaged users within individual projects on yearly snapshots can be an indication of their success or decline

Education - The percentage of ppl who dive deeper into videos/articles/Discord after reading the team‚Äôs X

# üóø Data sources

All of the data is taken from open sources (mostly X, Youtube, Medium, Linkedin, Github, app stores, teams websites and comms, gov proposals) some fields might be empty. The database is being updated 2 times per year by @faultcore and @oshakarishvili to the best of our knowledge. We welcome you to update it as well, especially if you are part of the project.

*The directory is available for general information purposes only and is not an official endorsement of the projects by JUST team.* 

*We will also take the liberty of not disclosing some of the metrics by which we evaluate projects, although we would be more than happy to engage in a productive discussion about unifying the metrics by which projects in the ecosystem are categorized.*
